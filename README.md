# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## What we're trying to do here:
Create a scheduler with a time-slot for each business hour. Each slot allows us to add text, and save that text to local storage. When we refresh the page, the save tasks will also reload. The colors will also change on the planning during the day, to tell us which tasks are past, present and future.
